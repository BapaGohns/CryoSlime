# CryoSlime
A basic Mee6 replacement

Features include but probably aren't limited to:

Youtube Notifications (Done, but could use expansion)
Guild Member welcome messages (Done, but could use expansion)
Ping (Functional, needs some expansion)
Fanfic sending (pls add tts thnx)
Custom shaming and insults (Always changing)
Basic Command logging (Done, but could use expansion)

Please note, this bot in its current state is only functional in a Guild I'm a part of. If you aren't in that server and you want to use this bot, you have a lot of replacing to do. Thanks for reading!
